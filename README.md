# bad-pokemon-app

This is an example of a badly perfoming Vue 3 app. 
The server provides a list of 809 pokemons (credits to https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json) and the app lists them in a table, with images and buttons to increment the stats.

## To run 

```
cd pokemon-server
npm i
npm run start

cd pokemon-app
npm i
npm run serve
```
